  "description": "* It is a JavaScript runtime. * It allows JS code to be run on the server. * This means we can use node.js to run JS outside of the browser. * It uses V8 engine build by Google that runs JS in the browser. * The engine takes JS code compiles it to machine code. * V8 is writtent in C++. * CGPT -     * Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.     * It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it possible to run JavaScript on the server side.     * Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl and was first released in 2009.     * Key features of Node.js include:         * Asynchronous and Event-driven:              * Node.js is designed to handle asynchronous programming efficiently.              * It uses a non-blocking, event-driven I/O model that allows it to handle concurrent connections without getting stuck on slow operations, making it highly scalable and efficient for handling real-time applications.         * Fast Performance:              * Node.js is built on the V8 engine, which is the same JavaScript engine used by Google Chrome.              * This engine compiles JavaScript into machine code, resulting in fast execution and improved performance.         * Cross-platform:              * Node.js is cross-platform and can be run on various operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.         * NPM (Node Package Manager):              * Node.js comes with NPM, a powerful package manager that enables developers to access and use thousands of pre-built, open-source libraries and modules, simplifying the development process.         * Server-side Applications:             * With Node.js, developers can build web servers, networking tools, real-time chat applications, streaming applications, and many other types of server-side applications.         * JavaScript Language Familiarity:             * Since Node.js uses JavaScript, developers can use the same language on both the client and server sides, reducing the need to switch between different languages for web development.     * Node.js has gained immense popularity in recent years due to its efficiency, performance, and extensive community support.      *  It has become a go-to choice for building modern web applications and services, especially in scenarios requiring real-time interactions or handling a large number of concurrent connections.",
